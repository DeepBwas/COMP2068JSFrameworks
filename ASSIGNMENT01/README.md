# Assignment 01
This is for a project for JavaScripts Frameworks class. A personal web portfolio using node, bootstrap, express and handlebars. It has 4 pages, home, about me, projects and contact me. I have made this website Elden Ring themed as that is one of my favourite game.
I have used some bootstrap, but most of it is custom CSS. The website is somewhat responsive, it does not break completely on smaller sceens.
